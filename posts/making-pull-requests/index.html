Yes I am. I have wanted to contribute to an open source project for a really, really long time. I am unreasonably psyched about the whole experience right now.\nTrigger warning: I am going to be unironically enthusiastic. Sorry.\nHere is how I did the do It was unbelievably easy. I noticed in the github news stream that one of my friends had starred a project, and it looked kind of cool. The project was micahflee/onionshare and I liked it because I like Tor and I think onionshare is awesome and I can absolutely see someone needing to use it.

At the time there were two similar issues, one about Localization and a pull request to Add Spanish translations. That’s when I realised “I can read in other languages, okay, not at all well, but I can definately do it!” So I cloned micahflee/onionshare. The code was very nice, I had no trouble figuring out what I would have to do, I could see that the i18n strings were loaded from a json file.\nI spent the next about an hour researching what I hoped were good translations by typing what I thought was the correct phrasing into google.fr, and checking how well it matched what French speakers actually use on message boards, in blogs and so on. It was a bit of a challenge to match the style of language in the English translation, and I think I sucked pretty hard.\nI forked micahflee/onionshare to create my own repo, and cloned it. On my machine I edited the strings.json file with my lovingly collected French words, staged, committed and pushed.\nThen I got stage fright. My translations are all wrong. The patch is totally trivial. I’m not even French. But I really wanted to contribute something, and that pushed me to create the pull request. It sounds like a little thing, but I suppose it’s a bit like being new at school, it feels like there is a lot of pressure to make a good impression. It is a little thing, but it was actually the hardest part.\nIt took maybe an hour before my pull request was merged, and it was pretty awesome.

I’ve been a software engineer for two years, and it’s taken me all this time to make a contribution.
