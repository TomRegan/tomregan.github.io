*All bloggers tend to pass through three phases: enthusiasm, occasional updates,
and blogging about blogging...*

I got a little bit tired of the magic behind [Octopress](http://octopress.org)
and decided to move to the 'better for Me(tm)' platform [Pelican](http://pelican.readthedocs.org/en/3.1.1/).
Pelican has been lovely and although Octopress was a great way to get started,
I'm not blessed with a great deal of web-dev-ishness, I was never going to 
take the time to understand its many bundled frameworks.

I've got Pelican working with just bootstrap. There's a little way to go,
and the move has inevitably broken a few things (things I couldn't be
bothered fixing yet), but I'm pleased at how easy it's been.

In the near future I'm going to fix the style, code snippets and broken
links.

*The first phase is characterised by the question 'what should I write?',
the second by the question 'who cares?' and the third by the question
'wheeee! is that a keyboard?'.*
