title: Bringing Eclipse Shortcuts to XCode

When I first arrived in the real world, I was introduced to new things;
amongst these were 'collaboration' and 'gigantic code bases'. I 
grudgingly accepted the need for an IDE, and started to use Eclipse. There
are actions I use in Eclipse regularly that I find really useful, like
searching and manipulating text.

Recently doing some Cocoa development and getting started with XCode,
I've been slowed down by having to learn these same actions again,
using different, and sometimes hand-contorting, Emacsian keys. So,
here's my own personal reference. You can use it too if you really like.

### Searching
* `⌘` `O` Open Quickly (Like Eclipse `⌘` `⇧` `R`)
* `^` `6` Ouick outline (`⌘` `O`)
* `⌘` `G` / `⇧` `G` Find next highlighted (`⌘` `K`/ `⇧` `K`)
* `⌘` `⇧` `F` Find in workspace (`^` `H`)

### Editing and refactoring
* `⌘` `⌥` `[` / `]` Move line up/down (`Alt` `↑`/ `↓`)
* `⌘` `^` `E` Rename variable in scope (`⌘` `⌥` `R`)

### Running and building
* `⌘` `R` Run (`⌘` `⇧` `F11`)
* `⌘` `B` Build (`⌘` `B`)

And there's support for emacs keybindings too, which makes moving
the cursor, as well as yanking and killing regions a little bit
easier.
